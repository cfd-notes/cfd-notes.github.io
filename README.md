# CFD Notes

A small website about everything related to CFD. Created for the purpose of having one simple and easily accessible place where I could store my notes. It is mostly a collection of paraphrases from books or scientific articles, all with proper written references so it is possible to track this information to the source.

This webside is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and wonderful open source theme [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).
